  	Each club in a division then falls under a district which is usually bounded by state lines. During the annual district convention, delegates from all clubs in the district elect a Governor, Secretary, Treasurer, and Publications Editor to service on the District Executive Board. A board of district chairs is then appointed in order to carry out specific district focuses and events throughout the year in which clubs from all over the district can participate and attend.
